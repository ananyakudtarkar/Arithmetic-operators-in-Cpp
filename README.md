Aim: To demonstrate the basic operators in C++

Theory:

Arithmetic operators in C++ are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numerical values. These operators work with both integer and floating-point data types.
ðŸ”¹ List of Arithmetic Operators
Operator	      Symbol	           Description	                           Example
Addition	        +	            Adds two operands	                         a + b
Subtraction	      -	          Subtracts second operand from first	         a - b
Multiplication	  *	           Multiplies two operands	                   a * b
Division	        /         	Divides numerator by denominator	           a / b
Modulus	          %	     Returns remainder of division (integers only)	   a % b

Logical operators in C++ are used to combine or manipulate boolean expressions (expressions that evaluate to true or false). These operators are primarily used in decision-making and control flow statements like if, while, and for.

They help determine the truth value of complex conditions by connecting multiple logical or relational expressions.
ðŸ”¹ Types of Logical Operators
C++ provides three main logical operators:

Operator	Name	Description
&&	Logical AND	Returns true if both conditions are true
`		`
!	Logical NOT	Returns true if the condition is false


Conclusion:
Arithmetic operators are fundamental tools in C++ that allow you to perform calculations, control logic, and build complex expressions. Mastery of these operators, along with an understanding of precedence and data types, is crucial for effective programming in C++. Always be mindful of integer division and operator precedence to avoid unexpected results.Logical operators in C++â€”&&, ||, and !â€”enable complex decision-making by allowing multiple conditions to be evaluated together. Understanding their behavior, including short-circuit evaluation and boolean logic, is essential for writing reliable and efficient programs.
